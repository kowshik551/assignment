What is identifier?
In Python, an identifier is a name given to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other object.

Rules for naming identifiers:
Can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
Must start with a letter or an underscore.
Cannot start with a digit.
Cannot be a Python keyword (e.g.,if,else,for,while).
Case-sensitive (myVariable and MyVariable are different identifiers).
Should be meaningful and descriptive to improve code readability.

Examples of valid identifiers: 
my_variable, name, _age, calculate_total, and Class1.

Examples of invalid identifiers:
1st_variable (starts with a digit), my-variable (contains a hyphen), and class (is a Python keyword).
