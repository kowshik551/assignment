'''ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) in Django is a technique that allows you to interact with databases using Python code, rather than writing raw SQL queries.
 
*Key Features:*
 
1. Database Abstraction: Interact with different databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) using a unified API.
2. Object-Relational Mapping: Represent database tables as Python classes and objects.
3. Querying: Perform complex queries using Python syntax.
4. Data Modeling: Define database schema using Python models.
 
*Django ORM Components:*
 
1. Models: Define database tables as Python classes.
2. Fields: Represent individual columns in a database table.
3. QuerySets: Collections of objects retrieved from the database.
4. Managers: Interface between models and the database.
 
*Django ORM Benefits:*
 
1. Database Portability: Switch between databases without changing code.
2. Improved Productivity: Focus on Python code, not SQL.
3. Reduced SQL Errors: ORM handles SQL generation.
4. Better Security: ORM protects against SQL injection.
