#SET: set is a collection datatype which holds group of values.
# 1)Set represnted by using curly braces {}.
# 2)Set doesn't allow duplicates.
# 3)In set insection order is not preserved.
# 4)Set doen't suport indexing.
# 5)Set is a mutable object.
# 6)Set within a set is not allowed.
# 7)We can perform mathamatical operations on a set object.
