#1. Basic List Operations:
#1.Write a Python program to create a list of 5 integers and print the sum of all elements in the list.

lb=[1,2,3,4,5]
print(sum(lb))

#2.Create a list of strings containing the names of 5 fruits. Access and print the second and fourth elements using indexing.

lb_2=["banana","apple","cherry","water meoln","kiwi"]
print(lb_2[2])
print(lb_2[4])

#3.Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Use slicing to print the first three numbers, the last three numbers, and every second number in the list.

lb_3=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print(lb_3[0:3])
print(lb_3[-3:])
print(lb_3[1:11:2])
