#4. Hierarchical Inheritance

#2.Problem Statement: Create a base class Vehicle with attributes brand and model. Then, create two derived classes Car and Bike, both inheriting from Vehicle, and adding their own attributes and methods.

'''Tasks:
Define a base class Vehicle with attributes brand and model.
Create a derived class Car that inherits from Vehicle and adds an attribute num_doors.
Create another derived class Bike that inherits from Vehicle and adds an attribute type.
Implement methods to display the details of the vehicles.
Create instances of both Car and Bike and display their information.'''

    def __init__(self):
        self.brand = input("Enter Vehicle Brand Here : ")

#5. Hybrid Inheritance
#Problem Statement: Create a class structure to represent hybrid inheritance:

'''Device: Base class with name attribute.
Phone: Derived from Device with an additional phone_number attribute.
Tablet: Derived from Device with an additional screen_size attribute.
Smartphone: Derived from both Phone and Tablet with an additional attribute os.

Tasks:
Define a base class Device with an attribute name.
Define a class Phone that inherits from Device and adds an attribute phone_number.
Define a class Tablet that inherits from Device and adds an attribute screen_size.
Define a class Smartphone that inherits from both Phone and Tablet, adding an attribute os.
Implement methods to display all attributes of the Smartphone.
Create an instance of Smartphone and display its information.'''

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = input("Enter Device Name Here : ")

    def device_details(self):
        print("Device Name : ", self.name)

#6.Basic Inheritance
#Problem Statement: Create a class Person with attributes: name and age. Create another class Student that inherits from Person and has an additional attribute grade. Define methods in both classes to display the attributes.
''''
Tasks:
Define a Person class with an __init__ method to initialize name and age.
Define a Student class that inherits from Person, with an additional attribute grade.
Define a display_info method in both Person and Student classes to print all attributes.
Create objects for both Person and Student and display their information.

#Data Abstracion:-  used to hide unnecessary information and display only necessary information to the users interacting.

#1. Abstract Classes: These are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. You can create abstract classes using the abc (Abstract Base Class) module.
 
 
#2. Abstract Methods: Methods in an abstract class that have no implementation. They must be overridden in any subclass.


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Car(ABC):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):

    def printDetails(self):
        pass
  
    # Create concrete method
    def accelerate(self):
        print("Speed up ...")
  
    def break_applied(self):
        print("Car stopped")

# Create a child class
class Hatchback(Car):

        print("Brand:", self.brand)
        print("Model:", self.model)
        print("Year:", self.year)
